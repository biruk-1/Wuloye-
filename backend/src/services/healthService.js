 * services/healthService.js — Phase 18 readiness-aware health check

 *
 *   status "ok"       — service is live AND Firestore is reachable  → HTTP 200
 *   status "degraded" — service is live BUT Firestore is unreachable → HTTP 503
 *
 * The probe uses a limit(1) read on a "_health" collection (documents need not
 * exist — the round-trip itself confirms connectivity).
